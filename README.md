# PROJECT 4

# CARS COLLECTOR APP

## Description
In the tenth week of my Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp, I developed and deployed a full-stack web application with Python servers and SQL databases built with the full-featured framework Django and styled with Bulma, a CSS framework. The purpose of the Cars Collector application is to display trending cars of 2022. The vehicle types range from electric, to sports, to luxury, to off-road, and so on and so forth. I've implemented authorization/authentication allowing users to contribute to the list of trending vehicles of 2022. With this implementation, not only will you be able to view the full list of trending vehicles but you'll also be able to contribute as well. There's pages in the application for both view options so you can keep track of the vehicles you've contributed. As always, responsive design was accounted for so enjoy this application on all your devices.

### Technologies Used
Python, Django, Django Admin, PSQL, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bulma, Responsive Design, Authentication/Authorization, Netlify

#### Next Steps/Future Enhancements
While adding data by hand keeps the application personalized, it would make sense to add an API to interact with that will fetch current trending vehicles. Implementing this will allow more information to be retrieved and provided for the car enthusiasts.
