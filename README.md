# PROJECT 4

# CAR COLLECTOR APP

## Description
In the tenth week of my Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp, I developed and deployed a full-stack web application with Python servers and SQL databases built with the full-featured framework Django and styled with Bulma, a CSS framework. The purpose of the Cars Collector application is to display trending cars of 2022. The vehicle types range from electric, to sports, to luxury, to off-road, and so on and so forth. I've implemented authorization/authentication allowing users to contribute to the list of trending vehicles of 2022. With this implementation, not only will you be able to view the full list of trending vehicles but you'll also be able to contribute as well. There's pages in the application for both view options so you can keep track of the vehicles you've contributed. As always, responsive design was accounted for so enjoy this application on all your devices.

### Technologies Used
Python, Django, Django Admin, PSQL, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bulma, Responsive Design, Authentication/Authorization, Netlify

#### Getting Started
To browse this application, click on the following link: https://jeffreygreen-cars-collector.herokuapp.com/. You will be loaded into the welcome page with navlinks at the top to sign up and/or log in if you are an existing user. After successfully logging in, you will be redirected to the "Cars" list page displaying all of the trending cars. You have he option to browse the trending cars already provided, or you can search for a specific vehicle using the search engine. There's also an "Add a Car" button to add a vehicle you find trending currently. If you wantto view all of your added cars, go to the nav link and click on the "My Cars" option.

#### Next Steps/Future Enhancements
While adding data by hand keeps the application personalized, it would make sense to add an API to interact with that fetches current trending vehicles. Implementing this will allow more information to be retrieved and provided for the car enthusiasts. Another stretch feature I'd like to add to benefit users is a like button. While scrolling through the trending cars, I'd like to build functionality for user's to be able to like a vehicle and store that data in a sperate web page called "My Liked Cars." The further I get in my software engineering/web development journey, the more additions I'll be able to make as I am constantly learning new technologies!
